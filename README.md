# Etch-and-Sketch
Assignment: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch

They really dont give alot of tips on this one. Need to research it myself.

Plan:
Create a simple container that holds the amount of needed squares.
Fill the container with squares using javascript

The square divs should have a class for uniform design and an ID to target the individual squares.

Stuff to learn before i can do this:
- CSS Grid

Enough practice with grid and now i am able to create a container with automated divs to the size of my choosing.

Next assignment is to create a button that allows the user to input the amount of squares they want.

And that is also completed. This was alot of fun!
